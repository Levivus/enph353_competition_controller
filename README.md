As part of a class, I competed in a competition with a partner where we controlled a simulation robot in gazebo. The task was to find and detect clues around the map. 
The robot was controlled using ROS, and the inputs to the algorithm were ROS subscriptions to a camera on the robot, and a clock. 
To see a detailed explanation of the competition and our strategy, see the [final report](ENPH_353_Final_Report.pdf) where it is outlined.
